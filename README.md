# Alpha-Sign-Up -- Currently not working
This is a Python script that automatically goes to a webpage with a sign up form then generates a username, email and password. It submits the form and waits for the activation email. Then it activates the account. There is a zip file that contains an executable but, when I try and download it chrome stops the download because it thinks there is a virus. Feel free to copy the executable.py code and make your own executable.
